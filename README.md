## Hi, I'm Elvia 👋🏼 👩🏻‍💻

<!--
**elvias9/elvias9** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->


I am a *developer*, a linguist and a translator.  What do these things have in common? Languages as structured systems of communication. 
As a developer, Javascript is my main language, but I’m learning Python as well. 
I currently work as a **Cloud Systems Developer**, migrating workloads from traditional datacenters to the cloud. I work primarily with *AWS* and *GCP* cloud providers.
I decided to move the first steps into the ’tech’ world because I think that here respect for everyone’s contribution is still a thing. Therefore, I would like to contribute myself in creating technology to elevate people and build a respectful community. 

- 🌱 I’m currently improving my knowledge of Terraform and CI/CD automation
- 🔭 I’m working on small personal projects to add on my knowledge of GCP and AWS
- 👯 I like being part of teams where I can grow through shared knowledge and constructive feedback
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love travelling, books, crochet, knitting, and cooking... I'm a grandma inside 🙃
