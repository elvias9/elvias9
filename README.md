## Hi, I'm Elvia 👋🏼 👩🏻‍💻

<!--
**elvias9/elvias9** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->


I am a *web developer*, a linguist and a translator.  What do these things have in common? Languages as structured systems of communication. 
As a developer, Javascript is my main language, and React.js, Express.js, Node.js the technologies I’m currently using. 
I decided to move the first steps into the ’tech’ world because I think that here respect for everyone’s contribution is still a thing. Therefore, I would like to contribute myself in creating technology to elevate people and build a respectful community. 

- 🌱 I’m currently improving my knowledge of React.js and learning Typescript
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a web app for food suggestions
- 👯 I’m looking to be part of a team where I can grow through shared knowledge and constructive feedback
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love books, crochet, knitting, and cooking... I'm a grandma inside 🙃
